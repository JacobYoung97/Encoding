# Encoding

This is a basic program that will encode/decode some text given to it. I am following the tutorial given in the description.
However, I am changing some of the text to have a slightly better look to the code itself.

## Basic Input Version (non-pretty output)
[First version: commit #3f48beb3561deb1a0f50797e96faf3175739128b](https://github.com/JacobYoung97/Encoding/commit/3f48beb3561deb1a0f50797e96faf3175739128b)

## Basic Input Version (formatted output)
[Second version: commit #61eefc7b476fd99e7120cade5f737aef4603e445](https://github.com/JacobYoung97/Encoding/commit/61eefc7b476fd99e7120cade5f737aef4603e445)

## First hex decoding (hex to decimal)
[Third version: commit #88fc79bc94322ab1488cd726cc08c850739a6ed3](https://github.com/JacobYoung97/Encoding/commit/88fc79bc94322ab1488cd726cc08c850739a6ed3)

## Second hex decoding (prints hex formatted with the encoder)
[Fourth version: commit #ff5b9c5ee09ba652bc4d4551367a3de2d0eedf9a](https://github.com/JacobYoung97/Encoding/commit/ff5b9c5ee09ba652bc4d4551367a3de2d0eedf9a)
